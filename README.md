LaTeX: To help change metrics of the fonts of japanese-otf package

This package changes the setup of the japanese-otf package, so that the
TFMs for direct input are all replaced by new ones with prefixed names;
for exmaple, `nmlminr-h` will be replaced by `foo--nmlminr-h`, where
`foo` is the prefix specified by the user.

This function will assist the users who want to use japamese-otf package
together with tailored TFMs of Japanese fonts.

Note: The name “jodel” stands for “Japanese Otf DELuxe” (and “deluxe”
is a package option of japanese-otf) and is not at all related to yodel
singing (although some sense of word-play is intended).

Note: The “jodel” part of the package name stands for “**j**apanese-**o**tf
**del**uxe”. Here “deluxe” is the name of japanese-otf’s option for
employing multi-weight Japanese font families. This option is probably the
most likely reason for using japanese-otf. So this package is really about
japanese-otf’s “deluxe” option, hence the name. It is not related to
yodel singing, although some sense of word-play is intended.
